# CubeMars AK Parameters
This folder contains the motor settings of the two CubeMars AK70-10 motors. We changed the PID parameters but otherwise mostly used the default parameters.

In order to load the settings you have to execute the following steps:
1. Open CubeMarstool_v1.32.exe
2. Connect to the COM port
3. Switch to Servo Mode if the "SERVO MODE" box is not red
4. Click "Import Settings" and choose the McParams and AppParams file
5. Click  "Write Parameters"

Changing parameters can be done directly in the CubeMars UI or by editing the McParams/AppParams file and then following the above procedure.
